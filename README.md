fake-wpilib
===========

fake-wpilib is now deprecated and should not be used anymore. Instead, we 
recommend that you use pyfrc, which contains an implementation of fake-wpilib
in it, with new features to make working with RobotPy code even easier.

See the pyfrc github site for more info: https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc

If you really want to use fake-wpilib, just use the following git command to
checkout the last commit of fake-wpilib. 

    $ git checkout archive
